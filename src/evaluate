""""How well does the program recognize handwritten digits? 
Start by loading in the MNIST data with a helper program, mnist_loader.py.
After loading the MNIST data, we'll set up a Network of 30 hidden neurons 
with the neural network object we defined, network.py.
Finally, we'll use stochastic gradient descent to learn from the 
MNIST training_data over 30 epochs, with a mini-batch size of 10, 
and a learning rate of Î·=3.0.
